      "description": "Life Extension’s Two Per Day multivitamins have the highest nutritional potencies of any science-based multivitamin formula that can fit inside two capsules or Capsules. This gives you far more of the essential vitamins, minerals and health-promoting nutrients than typical store-bought formulas … and it does so at a very economical price. Why is this so important? While Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) were developed by the government, they only provide the minimal doses to protect you from deficiency. Research studies demonstrate that unless you’re taking the ideal dose of vitamins and minerals, you won’t fully receive their benefits for optimal health and well-being. Two-Per-Day now contains three potent forms of selenium (SelenoExcell, Se-methyl-selenocysteine, and sodium selenite). Also newly included is apigenin, a powerful bioflavonoid found in many vegetables and fruits which boosts cell protection.",
